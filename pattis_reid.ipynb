    "    (a) First and foremost, I would like to establish that I have permission to access and sample the data on boxrec.com from the owner of the website himself/herself, and, as evidence, I will store the email correspondence as a PDF file within the inf510_project/data/permissions directory. Having said that, the website boxrec.com had back-end scripts that prevented too many requests from the same IP address with same headers. Thankfully, after 48 hours worth of research, I managed to use two techniques that solved the problem – proxy-rotation and fake user headers. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    For proxy-rotation, I extracted free, fast proxies from https://free-proxy-list.net/. Once I extracted a list of proxies that are both valid and efficient in accessing boxrec.com, I will use the proxies *in random order* to request the contents from the web page. By accessing the website using random proxy servers, I was able to bypass the back-end scripts that detect for anomalies.  \n",
    "\tAnother concern I had was that the website also checks for user headers of recent requests – too many requests in with the same headers look suspicious. For this, I installed the fake_useragent module from Anaconda Cloud. With this module, I was able to generate random requests headers when requesting for the web page. \n",
    "\t\n",
    "    However, when combining the two methods into code, I encountered a severe problem. Some proxies can simply fail to connect for seemingly no reason at all. That was when I realized that the proxy servers are not guaranteed to work for every query. The server may work for some time, but suddenly not work for one single request, yet continue to work fine a minute later. Even though hiccups are tested to happen less than 0.05% of the time, it required me to slightly change my approach. Hence, I developed a new method of querying boxrec.com. \n",
    "\t\n",
    "    First, I request for the web page using 2 separate proxies, chosen at random from the list of proxies. If the first request successfully returns the page, then I do NOT request the second time. However, if both queries failed to successfully return the page, then I will use my *own* IP address but with a randomly-generated user header. Lastly, if that does not work, then I will use my own IP address but with my own actual user header, which is guaranteed to work as long as I do not query too often using my own. Based on my test, the chances of me having to use my own IP address is around 3/650, which is below .005% and hence very reasonable. This approach was pretty efficient and guarded against any errors.

    "    (b)\tWhen requesting for the web page using the requests module. Initially, I was using requests.get to retrieve the module. However, I realized that it was far more efficient to create a requests.Session object and use session.get instead of requests.get. It turns out that every time I was creating a Response object from requests.get, I was creating a new requests.Session object also, which can be costly. Furthermore, based on my research, if I’m making requests to the same proxies over and over again, the TCP connection will be reused and improves performance significantly. https://2.python-requests.org//en/latest/user/advanced/#session-objects. This step improved my overall execution speed by a factor of 1.5. \n",
    "\t\n",
    "    Furthermore, I have decided to create an account on boxrec.com to keep my program accountable to the website. In short, I wanted my program to log into the website using requests.Session and requests.push(URL, data=login_params). This login step isn’t strictly necessary, but I certainly learned how to scrape a website that requires login information. "

However, an alternative explanation is that pro boxers from poorer countries tend to work harder on average compared to pro boxers from wealthier countries. "

    "    There were 2 major sources of difficulty. \n",
    "    \n",
    "\tThe first major source of difficulty was attempting to access the website on a continuous basis. At first, with only the knowledge I learned in class, I was very confused as to why the website is not returning the web page to me after the first 200 to 300 queries. After many hours of research and testing, I had finally realized that the website prevented too many requests from the same IP and user headers. Still, at first, I thought I could get around this by slowing the frequency* of my requests by using the time.sleep function from the time module. However, not only was the code unreasonably slow, the website was still rejecting the queries. That was when I wandered upon several data science articles and Stack Exchange posts on using random proxy servers and disguising my user headers. The implementation took me approximately 1 week and 2 days to complete, and I am proud of my creation.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\tThe second major source of difficulty was improving the efficiency of the execution. The first *full* version of my working program took a whopping 1 hour and 20 minutes to execute. So, I am very proud of my accomplishments in bringing the execution time down to a healthy 40-45 minutes for the full version. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    In the avenue of execution time, I made 3 significant changes. For boxrec.com, which is the difficult website alluded in the previous paragraph, I used requests.Session().get in place of requests.get. Then, I replaced “html.parser” with the “lxml” option for BeautifulSoup. Moreover, I found the SoupStrainer object, which significantly reduced the search time of the BeautifulSoup. "

Out of the many hours of research and trial-and-error, it took me a bit more than a week to implement a series of functions that perform proxy-rotation that is both efficient and produces a working program. If I had the ability to perform proxy-rotation before starting the project, that would have saved me at least 60 hours of time in tackling the project and much frustration. Having said that, I am pleased to claim that I have learned a substantial amount of knowledge in proxy-rotation and am able to successfully implement proxy-rotation. "

    "    To my surprise, even though there is no visible correlation between *average* win rates of Pro Boxers of a country and overall income level of the country, there is one more thing I can do. In hindsight, one Pro Boxer may have a record of 2 wins out of 2 matches, while another Pro Boxer may have a record of 39 wins out of 40 matches. Any serious boxer will claim that the latter boxer has a more impressive record than the first boxer, so taking the average alone would not be able to accurately reflect this fact. (100% vs. 97.5%) Hence, I believe that it would be more interesting to find the correlation between the average *number of wins* of Pro Boxers of a country and overall level of income of the country. This would in my opinion be of greater interest. \n",
    "    \n",
    "\tMy prediction is that wealthier countries have more wins because boxers receive more funding (and thus more incentive) to train to become professional boxers, while poorer countries have fewer wins because boxers receive less funding (and thus less incentive) to train to become professional boxers.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Since I have already built my proxy-rotation module, the process of sampling pro boxers' average number of wins on boxrec.com will be much more convenient, with the rest of the program identical to this one. "
